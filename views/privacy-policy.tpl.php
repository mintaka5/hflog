<p>Thank you for visiting the HF Logbook website. Your
	privacy rights are important to me and I am committed to using your
	information to help me provide you with better services.&nbsp; This
	policy explains my online privacy practices and how I collect and use
	your information.</p>

<p>The type of information I collect and this policy is subject to
	change without notice, and it reflects the HF Logbook&rsquo;s current business
	practices.&nbsp; Please revisit this policy statement regularly. It is
	intended to help you make informed decisions concerning disclosure of
	information in connection with the HF Logbook&rsquo;s website and related

<p>The HF Logbook will not share or exchange online information that you provide, 
    including e-mail addresses with third parties for their use. I
	will disclose personally identifiable information as required by law,
	for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. I also may
	disclose such information in response to law enforcement or regulatory
	agency&rsquo;s request. &nbsp;The HF Logbook is subject
	to the access and confidentiality provisions of the Public Records Act.</p>
<p>Although I take appropriate measures to safeguard against
	unauthorized disclosures of information, I cannot assure you that
	personally identifiable information that I collect will never be
	disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Some of my sites contain links to other sites whose information
	practices may be different than mine. I have no control over
	information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

	<strong>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</strong>

<p>If you do nothing during your visit but browse or download
	information, I may automatically collect and store the following types
	of information related to your visit:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used, but not the
		e-mail address.&nbsp; The Internet Protocol Address is a numerical
		identifier assigned either to your internet service provider or
		directly to your computer.&nbsp; I use the Internet Protocol Address
		to direct internet traffic to you and generate statistics used in the
		management of this site;
	</li>

	<li>The type of browser and operating system you used;

</ul>
<p>The information I automatically collect or store is used to improve
	the content of my web services and to help me understand how people
	are using my services.&nbsp; This information does not identify you
	personally and is used for website statistics.&nbsp; The information I
	automatically collect and store in my logs about your visit helps me
	to analyze my website to continually improve the value of the
	materials available. My website logs do not identify a visitor by
	personal information, and I make no attempt to link other websites
	with the individuals that browse the HF Logbook website.&nbsp; The HF Logbook does not
	sell &ldquo;electronically collected personal information.&rdquo;&nbsp;
	Any distribution of &ldquo;electronically collected personal
	information&rdquo; will be used solely for the purposes from which it
	was provided to me.</p>

<p>Some of HF Logbook&rsquo;s websites may provide or link to chat rooms,

<p>
	<strong>Disclaimer of Endorsement </strong>
</p>

<p>The HF Logbook is a distributor of content sometimes supplied by third parties
	and users. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other
	information or content expressed or made available by third parties,
	including information providers, users, or others, are those of the
	respective author(s) or distributor(s) and do not necessarily state or
	reflect those of the HF Logbook and shall not be used for advertising or product
	endorsement purposes. Reference herein to any specific commercial
	products, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer,

<p>
	<strong>Disclaimer for External Links </strong>
</p>
<p>The HF Logbook has links to other websites, and other websites may have links
	to the HF Logbook&rsquo;s website(s). These include links to/from websites
	operated by other agencies and officials, other government agencies,
	nonprofit organizations and private businesses. When a user leaves the
	HF Logbook website and visits another site, the user is subject to the
	privacy policy of that new site. The HF Logbook is not responsible for the
	contents of any off-site pages referenced. The user specifically
	acknowledges that the HF Logbook is not liable for the defamatory, negligent,
	inaccurate, offensive, or illegal conduct of other users, links, or
	third parties and that the risk of injury from the foregoing rests
	entirely with the user. Links from/to the HF Logbook web pages on the internet
	to/from other sites do not constitute an endorsement of the other sites
	by the HF Logbook. These links are provided as an information service only. It is
	the responsibility of the user to evaluate the content and usefulness
	of information obtained from other sites. The HF Logbook&rsquo;s websites contain
	links to other related websites and resources. Since the HF Logbook and its
	websites are not responsible for the availability of these outside
	resources or their contents, the user should direct any concerns
	regarding any external link to its site administrator or webmaster.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Disclaimer of Duty to Continue Provision of Data </strong>
</p>
<p>Due to the dynamic nature of the internet, resources that are free
	and publicly available one day may require a fee or restricted access
	the next, and the location of items may change as menus, pages, and
	files are reorganized. The user expressly agrees that the use of
	the HF Logbook&rsquo;s websites are at the user&rsquo;s sole risk. The HF Logbook does not
	warrant that the service will be uninterrupted or error free. The
	documents and related graphics published on this web or server could
	contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. Changes are
	periodically added to the information herein. The HF Logbook and/or its
	respective units and programs may make improvements and/or changes in
	the information and/or programs described herein at any time.</p>
<p>
	<strong>E-mail Addresses </strong>
</p>
<p>E-mail addresses obtained through the website will not be sold or
	given to other private companies for marketing purposes. The
	information collected is subject to the access and confidentiality
	provisions of the Public Records Act, other applicable sections of the
	California code as well as federal laws. E-mail or other information
	requests sent to the HF Logbook&rsquo;s websites may be maintained in order to
	respond to the request, forward that request to the appropriate staff
	within the HF Logbook, communicate updates to the HF Logbook page that may be of
	interest to citizens, or to provide the HF Logbook webmaster with valuable
	customer feedback to assist in improving the site. Individuals can
	cancel any communications regarding new service updates at any time.</p>

<p>
	<strong>A Special Note About Children</strong>
</p>
<p>Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of
	personal information, and I require that minors (under the age of 18)
	do not submit any personal information to me. This includes submitting
	personal information to the HF Logbook as part of a user profile or
	personalization profile. If you are a minor, you can use these services
	only if used together with your parents or guardians. If you are a
	minor, you should seek guidance from your parents.</p>
<p>If the HF Logbook decides to begin collecting personal information from
	children, I will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose
	the reasons for collecting it, and disclose my intended use of it.
	The HF Logbook will seek parental consent before collecting any personally
	identifiable information. If it does collect it, parents may request
	information on the type of data being collected, view their child's
	information, and, if they choose, prohibit the HF Logbook from making further use
	of their child's information. The HF Logbook will not provide personal
	information about children to third parties.</p>
